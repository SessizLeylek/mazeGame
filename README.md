# Maze Game
 School Project About Randomly Generated Maze Game
- Mostly Object Oriented but there are functional semantics here and there i don't know i don't care i hate python
- I impelemented random labyrinth generation and somewhat path finding algorithm all by myself because i was too lazy to read documentations
- I sent the report of this assignment exactly two minutes prior to the deadline, and it was awful
